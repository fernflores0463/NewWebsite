			<p>Hey! I'm Fernando and I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am majoring in Computer 
				Science and will pursue a minor in Computing Security.</p>
	
			<p>I have worked for some organizations before coming to RIT. I have worked for a company named Appigi, a service that connects people to the social resources they need and want.
			 	I curated their database so that it would be as accurate as it can get. I have also worked for a started got a ccompany named GVO Development, an independent game 
			 	studio that was created by two of my high school friends, it is based out of New Dorp High School in Staten Island.</p>
	
			<p>My passion for Computer Science stemmed from a program back in my high school days 	named <a href="http://www.nycgenerationtech.com">NYC Generation Tech</a> 
			where I built my first app. From there I started to go to hackathons and have been going to them ever since, I even help organize RIT's flagship 
			hackathon,<a href="http://www.brickhack.io"> BrickHack!</a> Now I am here at RIT, learning somethign new everyday.
